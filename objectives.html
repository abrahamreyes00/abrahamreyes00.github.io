        <li>
            Create a network infrastructure design communications document that includes identified hardware components,
            connections to outside world, identified physical layer connectivity (media) and addressing, including
            operational and security components in the design.
        </li>

            plan, an incident response policy, an acceptable usage document, an information security policy, a physical
            security policy, assessments or troubleshooting procedures.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
